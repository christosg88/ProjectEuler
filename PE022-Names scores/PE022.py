# Using names.txt (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), a 46K text file
# containing over five-thousand first names, begin by sorting it into
# alphabetical order.
# Then working out the alphabetical value for each name multiply this value by
# its alphabetical position in the list to obtain aname score.
# For example, when the list is sorted into alphabetical order, COLIN, which
# is worth 3 + 15 + 12 + 9 + 14 = 53, is the 938th name in the list.
# So, COLIN would obtain a score of 938 Ã— 53 = 49714.
# What is the total of all the name scores in the file?
